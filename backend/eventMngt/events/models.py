# we must define our own logic for creating users safely.

        user.set_password(password)

        # Save the user into the database
        #  In PostgreSQL, for a customer, this will generate a query like:

        # VALUES ('customer@email.com', 'Alice', 'hashed_password', 'customer', 'active', true, false, NOW(), NOW())

    # you can pass role='organizer' in extra_fields:
    # ðŸ‘‰ In PostgreSQL, this will generate:
